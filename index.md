### 3 way serial thought
The concept of parallel three-way thinking arises from personally lived experiences.

It is present where a decision has to be made and is as for the name divided into 3 parts.

When a technical question is asked there are always 3 answers in yuor mind:

1. The instinctive response, more immediate and direct
2. The slightly more reasoned answer arises from the fear of the extreme of the first answer, which goes in opposition to the first
3. And the most correct answer born from a prolonged reasoning, which will be similar to our first answer

All this just to say that the brain (unconscious) is extremely faster than our conscious thought, wanting to exaggerate you can say that our conscious incredibly slows down our processing of information and thoughts.
