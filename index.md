### 3 way serial thought
The concept of serial three-way thinking arises from personally lived experiences.

It is present where a decision has to be made and is as for the name divided into 3 parts.

When a technical question is asked there are always 3 answers in yuor mind:

1. The instinctive response, more immediate and direct
2. The slightly more reasoned answer arises from the fear of the extreme of the first answer, which goes in opposition to the first
3. And the most correct answer born from a prolonged reasoning, which will be similar to our first answer

__All this just to say that the brain (unconscious) is extremely faster than our conscious thought, wanting to exaggerate you can say that our conscious incredibly slows down our processing of information and thoughts.__

When you want to propose something and not just answer a technical question, the only way to make a correct thought is to take an extreme position in one direction (first point) and express it strongly without inhibition. Then take the opposite thought and do the same thing (second point). Only at the end of the third point will it be possible to clarify the problem raised.

_So yes it is three and serial the ways of thought._
